**Modernized bag system for the Genropy framework**

## Status: Beta

**Current Version:** 0.1.0

This project is in early development. The architecture and features are still being defined.

## Purpose

genro-bag aims to modernize the bag data structure from Genropy, providing a contemporary Python implementation with improved design and features.

The bag is a core data structure in Genropy used for hierarchical data storage and manipulation. This project will explore modern approaches to reimplementing this concept.

## Goals

- Modernize the bag architecture for current Python standards
- Maintain compatibility with Genropy framework needs
- Explore improved APIs and patterns
- Document design decisions and trade-offs

## Development

This repository serves as a central place for:
- Design discussions (via GitHub Issues)
- Architecture documentation
- Prototype implementations
- Feature proposals

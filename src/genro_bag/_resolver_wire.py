"""Wire encoding for BagResolvers, shared by the serializers and the parsers.

A resolver travels as a marked string, ``::RSLV:<payload>``, which every
format can carry: an XML attribute, a JSON string, a TYTX value. Formats
with real structure (JSON node dicts) keep using it too, so there is one
encoding to reason about rather than four.

Signing
    Pass a ``key`` and the payload is HMAC-signed with an optional expiry.
    Required whenever the Bag leaves the process and may come back — a
    resolver handed to a browser is under the client's control, and its
    arguments (a path, a URL) are what the resolver will act on. Without a
    signature there is nothing to stop those from being rewritten.
    Reading is symmetric: a key means signatures are demanded, no key means
    payloads are taken as they come.

Trust
    Decoding never calls the resolver — it is rebuilt inert, and any I/O
    happens later, when the caller reads the value. Class instantiation is
    guarded by ``BagResolver.deserialize``, which refuses anything outside
    the BagResolver hierarchy.
